# MNIST-Digit-Classification-k-nearest-neighbors-
Classification of MNIST data set using base R (and ggplot). Cross validation carried out to optimize k parameter. 
No libraries were used as the goal was to code everything from scratch. Label predictions on Kaggle test set provided as csv. 
The prediction results (in the form of error rate) are provided in .png attached.

The project was done using RStudio and uploaded to this git repository as an R Markdown file (.Rmd).
